# Hack-Her - LinkUpEducation

## What it is 
A platform for students to find peers to collaborate with on school work and assignments. 

## How it works
Once a user has registered and signed in, they're redirected to a browse page which lets them browse all of the courses available through the website. If a course doesn't exist yet, the user can create the course, which adds it to the database of courses. 

The user then can create an ad for what they're looking for pertaining to a course. This could be something simple like a lab partner, or a partner for an assignment. This also could be a medium for students to find study partners for different classes. 

Once an ad has been created, other users browsing the course will be able to match with you upon seeing your ad, and them posting their own ad.
